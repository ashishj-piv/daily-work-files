Hello David,

Thank you for reaching out regarding cost tracking for your VMs in the AW Server project. I've reviewed the current setup and confirmed that per-VM costs can be obtained using the instance-billing labels applied to each VM including for March 2025  directly from the GCP Billing Console.

How to View Per-VM Costs in March

Go to: GCP Billing Console

Select Billing Account: KloudStax US - theaamgroup.com

Navigate to Reports

Set the Date Range:

Time range: Custom → March 1–31, 2025

Group by:

Choose Service 

Add Label Filter:

Label key: instance-billing

Apply values: hh, aw1, aw2, aw4 (one at a time)

Review and Download:

Click Download CSV to export results



For ongoing reporting, automation, or dashboarding, we recommend enabling Detailed Usage Export to BigQuery via Billing → Settings. This will allow you to query costs using SQL and generate reports across time periods.

I have attached the Screenshot to View Per-VM Costs for your reference:


Please feel free to reach out for any further assistance.

Regards,
Ashish

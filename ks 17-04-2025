Hello Dave,

Thank you for the update.

Since your model was trained using Unsloth and saved in PyTorch format, the most effective way to deploy it on Vertex AI is through a custom container. This involves wrapping the model in a simple FastAPI or Flask application, containerizing it, and deploying it to Vertex AI via Artifact Registry.

Here is a summary of the steps involved:

    Package your model files and upload them to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

    Create an inference server using a framework like FastAPI or Flask, along with transformers and torch.

    Containerize the server and push the image to Artifact Registry.

    Register and upload the model to Vertex AI, linking it to the container image and artifact location.

    Deploy the model to an endpoint, allowing you to send prediction requests via REST API or the Python SDK.

Please feel free to reach out if you need any assistance during the process.

Best regards,
Ashish

Hi Dave,

Thanks for your patience while I looked into this.

Since your model was trained using Unsloth and saved in PyTorch format, the most effective way to deploy it on Vertex AI is via a custom container. This involves wrapping the model in a simple FastAPI or Flask application, containerizing it, and deploying it through Artifact Registry.

Here’s a quick overview of the steps:

Package your model files and upload them to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

Build an inference server using FastAPI or Flask, along with transformers and torch.

Containerize the server and push the image to Artifact Registry.

Upload the model to Vertex AI, linking it to the container image and artifact location.

Deploy it to an endpoint to serve predictions via REST or Python SDK.

Let me know if you’d like help with any of these steps — happy to assist!

Hello Dave,

Yes, there are some solid prebuilt images you can build on, depending on your setup:

Vertex AI’s prebuilt containers work well for standard PyTorch or TensorFlow, though they don't natively support .safetensors.

Hugging Face + FastAPI templates are a great fit for transformer-style models and can be adapted easily for Unsloth.

vLLM is a strong choice if you're aiming for optimized LLM inference, especially with LLaMA variants.


Let me know which direction you're leaning, and I can help with a base image or sample setup to get you started.

Regards,
Ashish

Hello Dave,

Here’s a solid Hugging Face + FastAPI template you can use as a starting point for deploying your Unsloth model on Vertex AI:

 Hugging Face + Fast API:

This example walks through deploying a Hugging Face model using a FastAPI container on Vertex AI. It includes a Dockerfile, predictor.py, and full deployment steps — should be easy to adapt for your model.
